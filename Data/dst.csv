"PP and QQ travels from DD to AA and break journey at MM in between. Somewhere between DD and MM, PP asks ""how far have we travelled?"" QQ replies, ""Half as far as the distance from here to MM"". Somewhere between MM and AA, exactly 300 km from the point where PP asks the first question, ""How far have we to go?"" QQ replies, ""Half as far as the distance from MM to here"". The distance between DD and AA is:",,,
"From a point PP, on the surface of radius 3 cm, two cockroaches AA and BB started moving along two different circular paths, each having the maximum possible radius, on the surface of the sphere, that lie in the two different planes which are inclined at an angle of 45 degree to each other. If AA and BB takes 18 sec and 6 sec respectively, to complete one revolution along their respective circular paths, then after how much time will they meet again, after they start from PP?",,,
"AA, BB and CC start simultaneously from XX to YY. AA reaches YY, turns back and meet BB at a distance of 11 km from YY. BB reached YY, turns back and meet CC at a distance of 9 km from YY. If the ratio of the speeds of AA and CC is 3:23:2, what is the distance between XX and YY?",,,
"Laila drives to the station each day to pick up her husband Majnu, who usually arrives on a train at 6 o’clock. Last Monday, Majnu finished work earlier, caught an earlier train and arrived at the station at 5 ‘o clock. He started to walk home and eventually met Laila who drove him the rest of the way, getting home 20 minutes earlier than usual. On Tuesday, he again finished early and found himself at the station at 5:30. Again he began to walk home, again he met Laila on the way, and she drove him home the rest of the way, Assume constant speed throughout with no wasted time for waiting, backing of the car etc. How earlier than the usual time were they home on Tuesday?",,,
"Three athletes AA, BB and CC run a race, BB finished 24 meters ahead of CC and 36 m ahead of AA, while CC finished 16 m ahead of AA. If each athlete runs the entire distance at their respective constant speeds, what is the length of the race?",,,
"Mukesh, Suresh and Dinesh travel from Delhi to Mathura to attend Janmashtmi Utsav. They have a bike which can carry only two riders at a time as per traffic rules. Bike can be driven only by Mukesh. Mathura is 300 km from Delhi. All of them walk at 15 km/h. All of them start their journey from Delhi simultaneously and are required to reach Mathura at the same time. If the speed of bike is 60km/h, then what is the shortest possible time in which all three can reach Mathura at the same time?",,,
